copy of your coursework submission may be made as part of the University of Brighton’s and School of Computing, Engineering & Mathematics procedures which aim to monitor and improve quality of teaching. If a copy is made, it will be kept only for this purpose and will be destroyed once this purpose has been fulfilled. You should refer to your student handbook for details.

All work submitted must be your own (or your team’s for an assignment which has been specified as a group submission) and all sources which do not fall into that category must be correctly attributed. The markers may submit the whole set of submissions to the JISC Plagiarism Detection Service.

## CI474 Portfolio ASSESSMENT BRIEF

Handout date 4/10/21 Individual Assignment

## Overall Concept:

Think of an idea for either a level for a 3d digital game or one single scene of an 3d animated film. Create a short written narrative of the action in the game or scene. Develop your idea into a working animated 3d scene using Storyboard and Concept art in the production process.

## Portfolio Assessment 01 (30%) – Hand in Deadline 1: 15.00 Thursday January 20th 2022

Storyboard, Concept Art, Report and 3d project. (30%)

Storyboard and Concept Art: Using your narrative as a starting point, you should produce a storyboard together with concept art, which clearly illustrates the narrative theme of your intended game level or scene, while making reference to planned production and postproduction processes. In the storyboard text, reference should be made to Camera Position and Angle, any Dialogue, Lighting Setup, Editing or Narrative and/FX setups. Text should be clearly written and typeset. For best results original drawings should be flatbed scanned not photographed. (scanners are available to use in the Aldrich library) Reference to audio content may include background music, incidental music, character dialogue, voice-over, and any other appropriate sounds. You may include still photography to visualise the storyboard. The storyboard need not cover the whole narrative, just the scene you will be completing in the second portfolio assignment. The storyboard must be supported with original concept art, illustrating the look and style of your intended 3d models, character, creature or vehicle. The concept art should show characters/objects in front side, back and 3/4 poses, and may also include views illustrating costumes, accessories, and or environments.

These should be submitted as a .Jpeg, .Pdf or .Psd file via student central by the above deadline.

Reflective Report: Describing the creative and production process, should contain images used to create or style the concept art, a mood board works well for this, as well as a description of the modelling process, concluding with a paragraph reflecting on the process and what you have learned. Care should be taken to correctly reference any images used.

Maya Scene: In addition, working from the storyboard and concept art, students should begin to produce a model of the background environment in only one of the storyboard scenes, using autodesk Maya software. Your environmental model should not be fully textured and lit, just modelled in rough form. The scene should be supported with screen grabs of the modelling process, you should include these together with text annotations in a short report to further illustrate this process. The scene should be delivered within a maya project folder with any textures used linked (using relative filepaths) to a location within that folder. (usually sourceimages folder)

## Deliverables: Submit for Deadline 1. (30%)

upload to: My Studies> CI474 Introducon to 3D Modelling and Animaon > Assessment and Marks > Assessment Submission Points > CI474 Porolio Assessment 01

Link to Module Assessment Submission Point: Click Here

3d Scene: your Maya scene should be saved as a .ma file (Autodesk Maya 2022 or earlier) and delivered within a Maya project folder structure.

Storyboard and Concept art. Your images should be scanned using a flatbed scanner, text should be typeset and the finished work should be submitted as a Jpeg, Pdf or Psd file. You may support your work with a written script or narrative.

Report: A short report detailing stylisc inﬂuences and any reference materials used should be clearly labelled with your name and saved in .doc or .pdf format. Report ﬁles submied in any other format will not be marked. Max word count 1000

The above deliverables should be placed in a single folder, compressed (zipped) and submitted via student central by the above deadline.

Formative feedback for this part of the portfolio assignment will be given online on or before February 17th 2022.

## Portfolio Assessment 02 (70%) – Hand in Deadline 2: 15.00 on Thursday May 19th 2022.

Maya Environmental Containing Character Model or Object Animation. (70%)

Working from the storyboard and concept art and continuing with the model created in the first portfolio assignment, students should produce a detailed model of the background environment in only one of the storyboard scenes, using Autodesk Maya software. Your environmental model should be fully textured and lit. Additionally, working from the concept art and storyboard, students should model one of the characters, creatures, objects or vehicles contained in the storyboard. The result should be placed in the environment, textured, then rigged (where necessary) and animated, using the techniques shown in class, with a rendered sequence submitted (no more than 30 seconds). The scene should be supported with comprehensive screen grabs, with text annotations, of the modelling texturing and rigging process, embedded in a reflective report (500-2000 words) to further illustrate the major workflow stages.

## Deliverables: Submit for Deadline 2 (70%)

upload to: My Studies> CI474 Introducon to 3D Modelling and Animaon > Assessment and Marks > Assessment Submission Points > CI474 Porolio Assessment 02

Maya Project Folder and Rendered Animation : your scene should be saved as a .ma file (Autodesk Maya 2022 or earlier) and delivered within a Maya project folder structure containing any texture images used (linked to a location inside the project folder), the finished animation rendered as an image sequence or .mov or .mp4 (quicktime) file, clearly named and saved inside the Maya project folder.

Reflective Report (500-2000 words): Describing the complete production process, should contain screen-grabs and text illustrating the modelling, texturing, lighting, animation and delivery stages, The report should be clearly labelled with your name in the heading and saved in .doc or .pdf format inside the Maya project folder. Report files submitted in any other format will not be marked.

The project folder should be compressed (zipped) and submitted to my studies by the above deadline.

Feedback for this part of the portfolio assignment will be given online on or before June 9th 2022.
