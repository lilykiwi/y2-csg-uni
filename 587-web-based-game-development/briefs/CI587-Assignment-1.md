# C587+CI328 – Assessment, Game Development Project

Author:		Robin Heath
Version:		2

## 1 Purpose

Design and develop the original code and assets required to implement a desktop style game playable within a browser window.

## 2 Requirement

Each student will undertake the design and development of a web based game utilising JavaScript and Phaser that can be played on a desktop computer equipped with a browser, mouse and keyboard.  The game must incorporate at least three of the following features:

- AI
- Physics/Collision Detection
- Player skill levels
- High score mechanism

Note: The sophistication and originality of the features will affect the final mark.

**Any non-original code and assets that you use must be clearly identified using comments within the submitted code and accurate references must be included within the references section of the report.**

## 3 Deliverables

The deliverables must include:

1. A runnable game meeting the requirements defined above together with all code and assets required to run it locally
2. Game report
3. Video demonstrating the game

## 4 Submission

The work must be submitted through the module area on StudentCentral as a single Zip file (details to be posted in the module area in due course).

Any work submitted later than 15:00, 14 Jan 2022 without an agreed extension will be treated as late.

## 5 Timetable

Date Set:			Week beginning 4 Oct

e-Submission Deadline:	15:00, 14 Jan 2021



# Assessment Criteria

Standard GEAR marking criteria will be applied. The criteria below provide an indication of what is expected from this piece of work. If a similar feature (not mentioned here) is delivered / implemented, it will gain marks as appropriate.

# Attachment 1 – Game Report Requirements

Students should use their discretion when documenting their work (more words do not mean more marks). A report will typically be equivalent to 2,500 words excluding any code listings.

## 1 Game Report

The purpose of the report is to describe the game and how it has been implemented.

**Note**:  The quality of the presentation and authoring style of the documentation will affect the overall mark.  **Only write in the third person.**

The report must address the following topics:

- Game Summary: Not more than one page describing the game’s:
  - Objective(s).
  - Rules.
  - Game play. (Include a story-board)
- Research:  Provide a critical review of the research you undertook explaining how it informed the design/implementation of the game.
- Screen/Level Map:  Provide annotated screen shots identifying all interactive elements and assets.
- Implementation Specification:  Where appropriate, provide clear explanations of the data structures and code used within game. These should include:
- Functions/Objects:  Describe any functions or objects that have been used to implement the game (eg a player object).
- Code Structure:  Document the overall flow of the code and where it is located within the source file(s).
- Assets:  Describe significant assets that are used within the game, particularly any assets that you created yourself.
- Implementation Evaluation: Provide a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies (platforms/frameworks etc) that you used to implement your game.
- **References:  You must clearly identify the source of any code/assets that you did not create**
- Appendix 1: Any further design sketches, background information, research that you wish to submit.
