## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is the second year of my Computer Science for Games repository, being
conducted at the University of Brighton in England. Most of the included
material is currently in a messy state, and I will be intending to fix it up and
present everything in the docs provided above by the end of the course.

The module codes for this course follow the template CI5XX, where CI is the the
module type, 5 is the level, and the last two numbers are the specific module
code. Additionally, each module has two assignments, one in the first semester,
and one in the second. The pass mark is 40% and my personal target is 70%.
