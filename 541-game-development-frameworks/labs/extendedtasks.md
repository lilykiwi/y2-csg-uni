# Extended Tasks

These tasks were included on the website but are not listed in the tutorials or lecture notes.

## Week 3

* Complete tutorial 2
* Become familiar with the Visual Studio IDE and how to create Console Applications using C++
* Build sample applications that print various data types to the terminal
* Become faimilar with the general documentation on C++: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/>
* Extra reading on types and variables: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type>

## Week 4

1. Complete tutorial 3
2. Develop an application that responds to user input using an if statement -- check <https://en.cppreference.com/w/> for more details on reading input
3. Consider how you would implement a user input in a game where you can pick up and drop an item using the same key.
4. Using concepts from step 3, implement an application where based on the internal game state you can pick up or drop items.
5. (Advanced) solve this problem using C++: <https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/> Hint: you will need more than just conditionals...

## Week 5

Complete tutorials 5 and 6 (functions and classes)

## Week 6

- Design one or more classes for your custom gameplay element (e.g. inventory, combat system, level up system, character customisation, weapon system, etc.)
- Implement at least one of these classes into a functioning terminal-based C++ application that can take user input, react to game state change and produce meaningful output resulting in full user interaction.

## Week 7

Complete tutorial 7 and 8

## Week 8

* (if you haven't complete it them yet) Complete tutorial 7 and 8
* Add use of references and pointers in your terminal game that you have been developing so far as part of workshops
* Alternatively, play around with GameMap.cpp from the video -- source code above.
* (advanced, extra reading) an article on C++ pointers: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pointer 
If any questions, feel free to email or message on Teams

## Week 9

* Complete tutorial 9 and also 8 if you missed it.
* Define class UsableItem and consider how you might turn into a health potion (restores player hp) or a teleportation stone (moves player from one location to another)
* Use an appropriate data structure to store UsableItem objects and allow the player to select a usable item
* (advanced) Design and develop a quest or tutorial system using data structures that can keep track of player's progress through a quest or tutorial. Each completed task should give the player some rewards.

## Week 10

* Ensure you are comfortable with C++ and you are able to build simple terminal-based applications. Recap tutorial videos and complete them if missed.
* Complete Unreal Engine tutorial 1
* Create Epic Games account if necessary -- so you can log in to Epic Games Launcher for UE
* Ensure you know how to run UE and start an existing template game

## Week 11

* Please watch video 2 Actor Transforms and video 3 Creating Actors
* Using the project for experiments from last week, create new Actors and put together simple structures: ramps, boxed rooms, stairs and platforms.
* Skim through the UE reference documentation on level design: <https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/LDQuickStart/>
* Ensure you are comfortable moving around in the 3D world
* Ensure you can translate, scale and rotate actors in a 3D scene
* Create a new project (to avoid interference with your experiments) using Third-person Template and save it for coursework.
* Please watch a GDC (you may wish to bookmark the channel -- they produce one of the highest quality content for game dev) conference talk on level design: <https://youtu.be/iNEe3KhMvXM>
* Using all of the materials from this session, start designing (and/or building) your level for coursework. Continue documenting your steps and actions in the report you created previously, to help save time in the future.

## Week 12

* Complete tutorial 4 and 5
* Using your coursework project, add a custom Actor
* Modify the Actor Blueprint to add custom logic that runs during every tick
* Add "print to screen" text during initialisation and shutdown of your custom Actor.
* Document any changes you made in the report you've been writing so far.
