# Requirements

1. **If one or more requirements are not met, the submission will not be accepted or will be penalised.**
    1. Design and develop a prototype game using Unreal Engine 4.25 or above (incl. UE 5):
       - The game must use the Third Person template (created via Blueprint project).
       - The game must have two (or combined into one) Easter Eggs that read: CI541-2021 and your name.

     1. Produce a technical report that describes the design and development of the game. Given page length is guidance, not a limit.
         - Title page: game name, student name, link to YouTube video (details below). No video will result in a 0 mark in “Implementation” crit.
          - Introduction (~0.5 page): the idea for the game. Screenshots of the Easter Eggs.
          - Development (~2 pages): highlight any technically complex implementation details and how you approached them. Justify the design and implementation choices that were made during the development.
          - Implementation (~2-4 pages): include developed Blueprints that are clearly readable (and C++ snippets if used) and clearly describe their purpose.
          - Critical Review (~1 page): identify three reasons why the design and implementation of the game are good. Further identify three reasons where the implementation could be improved and a summary of how the improvements could be made.
          - Conclusion (~0.5 page): what are the main take-away messages – what are the key concepts that you learned during the development.
          - Estimated grade: your self-assessed grade based on assessment criteria below. Example: Demo: A, Idea: A, Report: B
          - References: include references to existing articles (whether books,
        research papers, online blogs or educational videos). **Clearly identify
        and reference any 3rd party tutorials / assets / code used and provide
        their source and license. Failure to do this is likely to lead to
        serious consequences, including a 0 mark.**
     2. Record full gameplay (from game start to game over) using OBS (or similar) and upload to YouTube as “unlisted”.
        - Should be at least 720p, high quality and both Easter Eggs clearly visible
        - Voice-over (explaining gameplay aspects and implementation details) is recommended but not required
2. Deliverables
    1. Technical report in PDF format.
3. Submission procedure:
    - The report must be submitted through the Assessment & Marks area of this module on MyStudies as a single PDF file.

      Note: Students are allowed to submit work within two weeks of the published
    deadline (or agreed extension date), or the last working day immediately prior
    to the feedback date if this is shorter than two weeks. Any work submitted later
    than 15:00 of the date shown on the front page without an approved extension
    will be treated as late and capped at the pass mark.
