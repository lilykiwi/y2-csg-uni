# Requirements

1. **If one or more requirements are not met, the submission will not be accepted or will be penalised.**
    1. Design and develop a prototype game using Unreal Engine 4.25 or above (incl. UE 5):
       - The game must use the Third Person template (created via Blueprint project).
       - The game must have two (or combined into one) Easter Eggs that read: CI541-2021 and your name.

     1. Produce a technical report that describes the design and development of the game. Given page length is guidance, not a limit.
         - Title page: game name, student name, link to YouTube video (details below). No video will result in a 0 mark in “Implementation” crit.
          - Introduction (~0.5 page): the idea for the game. Screenshots of the Easter Eggs.
          - Development (~2 pages): highlight any technically complex implementation details and how you approached them. Justify the design and implementation choices that were made during the development.
          - Implementation (~2-4 pages): include developed Blueprints that are clearly readable (and C++ snippets if used) and clearly describe their purpose.
          - Critical Review (~1 page): identify three reasons why the design and implementation of the game are good. Further identify three reasons where the implementation could be improved and a summary of how the improvements could be made.
          - Conclusion (~0.5 page): what are the main take-away messages – what are the key concepts that you learned during the development.
          - Estimated grade: your self-assessed grade based on assessment criteria below. Example: Demo: A, Idea: A, Report: B
          - References: include references to existing articles (whether books,
        research papers, online blogs or educational videos). **Clearly identify
        and reference any 3rd party tutorials / assets / code used and provide
        their source and license. Failure to do this is likely to lead to
        serious consequences, including a 0 mark.**
     2. Record full gameplay (from game start to game over) using OBS (or similar) and upload to YouTube as “unlisted”.
        - Should be at least 720p, high quality and both Easter Eggs clearly visible
        - Voice-over (explaining gameplay aspects and implementation details) is recommended but not required
2. Deliverables
    1. Technical report in PDF format.
3. Submission procedure:
    - The report must be submitted through the Assessment & Marks area of this module on MyStudies as a single PDF file.

      Note: Students are allowed to submit work within two weeks of the published
    deadline (or agreed extension date), or the last working day immediately prior
    to the feedback date if this is shorter than two weeks. Any work submitted later
    than 15:00 of the date shown on the front page without an approved extension
    will be treated as late and capped at the pass mark.

| **Unsatisfactory (E/F 0-39%)**   | Technically too simple for L5, no evidence, e.g. video, or does not meet requirements.                                                                                                                                                               | No innovation or change from template, or no evidence.                                                                                             | Completely unsatisfactory and weak in all sections, or no submission.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Adequate (D 40-49%)**          | The demo is barely playable, limited demonstration of Unreal Engine usage. May contain some referenced 3rd party code / Blueprints. Very few assets used. Assets do not fit any specific genre / theme. Visually very simple, e.g. primitive shapes. | Game idea and gameplay design are repetitive or trivial, very little difference to third person template.                                          | A poorly structured report with vague language, may include some typos and require a lot of polishing. Covers key sections but to a poor extent. Weak response to technical content.                   |
| **Sound (C 50-59%)**             | The demo works to some extent, some demonstration of Unreal Engine usage. May contain some referenced 3rd party code / Blueprints. Assets form a single theme and of decent quality. Significant visual improvements can be made.                    | Game idea shows innovation and appealing gameplay compared to third person template, e.g. platformer, action.                                      | A well-structured report, very few typos. Covers most sections but to a poor extent. A sound response to technical content.                                                                            |
| **Good (B 60-69%)**              | The demo largely works to specification, appropriate demonstration of Unreal Engine usage. Sounds are expected. The code and Blueprints are mostly original. Assets used are appropriate, include some high quality. Visually, a coherent game.      | A strong foundation for an idea that approaches existing gameplay mechanics in new ways, e.g. puzzle, horror with several differences to template. | A clearly structured well-written report. Covers all sections to a reasonable extent. A good depth and breadth of knowledge are shown.                                                                 |
| **Excellent (A 70-79%)**         | The demo fully works, excellent use of the engine aspects (both developed and existing). A full range of assets is expected, including sounds, particle effects and materials. The code and Blueprints are fully original.                           | A fully original idea that builds on existing mechanics in unique or original ways, e.g. puzzle, horror with significant differences to template.  | Also uses precise terminology and concise in its narrative. Covers all sections, providing extensive links to other sources of information. Demonstrates clear understanding of the technical details. |
| **Outstanding (A+/A\* 80-100%)** | In addition, the demo is sophisticated enough (logically in implementation and visually) to be a publishable game prototype. Full range of assets with a professional level of quality, ready to be used in a publishable game.                      | A clearly innovative idea that blends multiple gameplay mechanics and extends them in original ways, e.g. open-world, racing / city sim.           | Also a deep understanding of the problem/solution in the domain is shown, with alternative solutions discussed. Sophisticated critical reflection. Professionally looking, clearly written report.     |
